Using [blaseball-scoreboard](https://github.com/iliana/blaseball-scoreboard) by [@iliana](https://github.com/iliana) as a base for a blaseball webapp with tts support.
I don't have experience making web accessibility tools, this was mainly made for personal use, so if you rely on tools like this to access blaseball, shoot me a message over at my primary account [@cahalane](https://github.com/cahalane).
